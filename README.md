# CinemaTime-Discord-Bot
Cinema Time is a discord bot that integrates the Letterboxd application that carries out miscellaneous tasks.

The bot uses a python library known as Beautiful Soup for webscraping capabilities. By parsing HTML code
from the website, the bot can display information for the user depending on their input.

**As of now, there are two working commands:**

  `!home` - Allows user to see the movies on the homepage of Letterboxd.

  `!info` - Prompts user to input any movie they'd like. Then displays information on said movie (Name, Director, Rating, Top 3 Actors, and Synopsis).


**In progress:**

  `!popular` - Prompts user to input a time period (all time, this year, this month, this week) and displays some of the top movies from that period.
  

**Ideas to be implemented:**

  `Recommendation` - Allows user to input a movie they like so the bot can display movies similar to it based on genre.

  `User's favorite films` - Allows user to input someones profile name on Letterboxd and display their favorite movies.

  `User activity` - Shows a Letterboxd users recent activity (when user watches, rates a movie, add a movie to their planning, etc.).
